💫 Hello, And Welcome! This Is My Nighttab Config💫

Here is where I keep my settings, themes, and assets for the Nighttab browser extension.

Its main purpose is to serve as a personal backup and to help me sync my setup across different browsers and computers.

❓ How to Use, For my future self (or you!):

Open Nighttab.

Click the Settings icon (cog wheel).

Go to the Data section.

Find the Restore card and click Select file.

Upload the settings.json file from this repo.
